# ALX Listing App

## Project Description

The **ALX Listing App** is a property listing application inspired by platforms like **Airbnb**. The app allows users to browse and view various property listings, with reusable components for displaying information such as property details, images, and actions (e.g., "Book Now", "View Details").

This project serves as a foundation for building a responsive and scalable property listing platform.

## Project Structure

- **`components/`**: Contains reusable UI components, such as `Card.tsx` (for displaying property details) and `Button.tsx` (for actions like "Book Now" or "View Details").
- **`interfaces/`**: Holds TypeScript interfaces to enforce type safety across the project. Examples include `CardProps` for the `Card` component and `ButtonProps` for the `Button` component.
- **`constants/`**: Stores constants such as API URLs and UI text that are reused throughout the app.
- **`public/assets/`**: A folder for all static assets like images, SVGs, and other media files used in the project (e.g., placeholder property images).
